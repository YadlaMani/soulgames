# Web3 Gaming Platform

Welcome to our Web3 Gaming Platform! This project aims to create a decentralized application (dApp) that introduces users to the world of Web3 through fun and interactive games. Our goal is to make Web3 technology accessible and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their technical background.

## Vision

As beginners in Web3, we wanted to create a dApp that's both entertaining and educational. This platform serves two main purposes:

1. Provide a fun gaming experience in the Web3 space
2. Help others explore and understand Web3 concepts without requiring extensive technical knowledge

## Current Project Status

The project is in its initial stages of development. We have set up the basic Next.js framework and are working on implementing the first game components.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Next.js framework
- **Styling**: CSS (with potential to add Tailwind CSS in the future)
- **Development Environment**: Node.js
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)

## Features (Planned)

- Multiple Web3-based games (starting with a simple game, expanding later)
- MetaMask integration for wallet connection
- Real-time updates of game states
- Leaderboard to track top players
- Educational resources about Web3 concepts

## Project Structure

- `src/app/dice/page.js`: Initial game component (to be expanded)
- `public/`: Static assets (to be added)
- `styles/`: CSS files (to be added)
